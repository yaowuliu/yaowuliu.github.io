I'm an Associate Professor in the School of Statistics at the [Southwestern University of Finance and Economics](https://e.swufe.edu.cn/). Perviously, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/) at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, working with [Dr. Xihong Lin](https://content.sph.harvard.edu/xlin/). I obtained my Ph.D. in Statistics from Purdue University in 2017, under the supervision of [Dr. Jun Xie](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/~junxie/). I received my master's degree in Statistics from Renmin University of China in 2014 and my bachelor's degree in Statistics from Beijing Normal University in 2011.


I'm broadly interested in developing novel statistical methodology that enables researchers to gain insights from massive and complex genetic datasets (e.g., whole-genome sequencing data). In particular, motivated from the need in genetic association studies, I've been heavily working on developing powerful and scalable testing methods for large-scale hypothesis testing, including p-value combination method, power-robust test, dynamic scan procedure, efficient p-value calculation, and sparse testing.
